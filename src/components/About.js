        <p>Welcome to my page! My name is Thang. I am currently attending UNC's Coding Bootcamp. I aim to become a Web
          Developer by graduation time. If I'm not inside coding, I enjoy going hiking or to the park with my dog. My
          hobbies include playing guitar, cooking, and running.</p>
